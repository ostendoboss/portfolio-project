This is my portfolio project at the end of the foundation phase in the ROADMAP to becoming a software engineer. In this project,  
itsMeta4 is a mobile app that helps users discover and explore various hotels and Recreational centers in their locality. 
The major aim is to provide a convenient platform for users to search for nearby hotels, view menus, read reviews, make hotel reservations, 
and to get a well reserved place for relaxation away from home.. So, I took it upon myself to come up with a kind of mobile/ desktop application 
that can answer this need.. This will be a very user friendly, light weight application. Stick up for updates!
